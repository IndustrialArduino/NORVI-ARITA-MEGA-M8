# NORVI-ARITA-MEGA-M8
Arduino ATMEGA 2560-based Controller with Digital inputs, Analog inputs, Relay Outputs, Transistor outputs, Ethernet, RS485, and OLED display.

NORVI Arita is a higher-capacity version of the NORVI Series. Selection of five standard models available with a choice of two powerful microprocessors. 
Arita is designed to yield every bit of performance in the microcontroller without compromising its reliability. 
It is compatible with almost every industrial input and output type. 
Connectivity is the factor that makes it suit today’s world, for a connected world, we have included all the industrially accepted communication methods in it. 
Arita is used everywhere, it has many characters, it can be a motion controller handling heavy positioning tasks or a data logging server.
